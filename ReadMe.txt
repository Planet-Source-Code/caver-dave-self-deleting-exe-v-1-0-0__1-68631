Title: Self - Deleting EXE v 1.0.0

This is the result of a my curiosity and a very ignominoius thread that I started in the vb.general.discussion newsgroup 
Thread address is:-

Any way this is the result in pure vb that does something and then creates a batch file to delete the exe.

Lump it or loathe it I did not write this for any malign purposes, so respect that!

Bend it break it use it as you like but:- 

If you like this code please vote for it
